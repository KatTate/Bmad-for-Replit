# BMad Method v6.0.0-Beta.7 — Replit Agent Configuration

## Overview

This project uses the **BMad Method** — an AI-driven agile development framework. It provides structured agent personas and workflows that guide projects from idea through implementation.

**How to use:** Just speak naturally. Say things like "act as the PM", "create a PRD", "what should I do next?", or use any 2-letter code (BP, CP, CA, etc.).

## Routing

When the user's message matches a BMAD trigger phrase, agent name, or workflow code:

1. **Read the routing table:** `_bmad/replit-routing.md`
2. **Match the request** to an agent or workflow using the trigger phrases listed there
3. **Load the matched file** and follow its instructions
4. **For workflows:** Execute using `_bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml` as the execution engine
5. **For agents:** Adopt the persona and present the agent's menu
6. **For "what's next?" or "help":** Execute `_bmad/core/tasks/help.md`
